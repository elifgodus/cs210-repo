# Spotify Data Analysis and Prediction

MORE DETAIL ON WEBSITE AND **PDF** **REPORT**


## Introduction

The primary focus of this project is the analysis of individual Spotify listening data collected over several years. The main objectives include:

- Identifying the top songs from 2017 to 2023
- Utilizing machine learning to predict the top 5 songs for 2024
- Monitoring shifts in Olivia Rodrigo's listening preferences
- Examining the top performers from 2020 to 2023

The culmination of these efforts is the development of an interactive website to present the results.

## Data Collection

Personal listening data was collected from Spotify to initiate the research process. The Spotify API was employed to extract this data, resulting in a comprehensive dataset. The dataset includes song titles, artists, play counts, and timestamps associated with each listening session.

To prepare the data for further analysis, it underwent the following steps:

- Thorough cleaning to eliminate outliers
- Handling missing values
- Ensuring consistency in the dataset

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the collected and processed Spotify listening data.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `webapp/`: The code for the interactive website presenting the analysis results.

## Website and PDF REPORT

A dynamic website featuring all of the data and visuals was carefully designed to encourage user involvement and investigation of the project's discoveries. The website is built using a combination of web development technologies, including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Explore the interactive website to engage with the project's data and visualizations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project serves as a prime example of how data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization approaches can be employed to extract valuable insights from Spotify user listening data. It showcases the use of these insights for forecasting preferences in the future, monitoring changes in musical preferences over time, and presenting results through an engaging and interactive website.

The initiative not only advances our understanding of individual listening preferences but also hints at broader applications, such as tailored music suggestions and the examination of larger patterns in music consumption. The project's outcomes contribute not only to the field of music data analysis but also to the potential enhancement of user experiences in the realm of personalized music recommendations.
